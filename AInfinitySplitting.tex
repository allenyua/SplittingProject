The main result of \cite{Arone} shows that the Mitchell-Richter filtration on $\Omega SU(n)$ (and more generally, for loops on a Stiefel manifold) stably splits.  The key insight is that this filtration has extra structure: it is a particular value of a \emph{functor} which has a natural filtration.  The tool that allows for the exploitation of this structure is Weiss's theory of orthogonal or unitary calculus.  

In this section, we extend the methods of \cite{Arone} to produce $\mathbb{A}_\infty$ stable splittings of Stiefel manifolds.  We will begin this section by reviewing the theory of calculus introduced in \cite{Weiss}.  We then make a statement about the multiplicativity of the construction which ...%ok I'll finish this after the section is actually written
