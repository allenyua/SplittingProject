\section{Introduction}

Write this last after we have filled in all the theorems with complete proofs.

%Notations
%Sp for spectra, S for spaces?
%Disclaimer: Using \infty cats everywhere
\section{Filtered and Graded Ring Spectra}

%Cite Rotation Invariance \cite{LurieRot} and lay out the basic theory.  Explain why an $\mathbb{E}_n$ filtered spectrum with $\mathbb{E}_n$-backwards maps must be split.
%I'd be happy to do this.  It's in progress below, but I'm not great with texing and notation so please give me suggestions.
%should probably write this for a general stable \infty category C
Here we review a framework from \cite{LurieRot} for studying graded and filtered objects.  The reader is referred to \cite{LurieRot} for a more thorough treatment and all proofs.  

Let $\C$ be a stable $\infty$-category.  Denote by $\Z_{\geq 0}$ the poset of non-negative integers, and by $\Z_{\geq 0}^{ds}$ the corresponding discrete category.  The reader is warned that our numbering conventions are opposite the ones in \cite{LurieRot}.  
\begin{dfn} 
Let $\Gr(\C)$ denote the functor category $\Fun(\Z_{\geq 0}^{ds}, \C).$  We shall refer to $\Gr(\C)$ as the category of graded objects in $\C$.  Its objects can be thought of as sequences $X_0, X_1,X_2,\cdots \in \C$.  
\end{dfn}
\begin{dfn} 
Let $\Fil(\C)$ denote the functor category $\Fun(\Z_{\geq 0}, \C).$  We shall refer to $\Fil$ as the category of filtered spectra.  Its objects can be thought of as sequences $Y_0\to Y_1\to Y_2 \to \cdots$ of spectra filtering $\colim_i Y_i$.  
\end{dfn}

%paragraph describes the functors
The obvious map $\Z_{\geq 0}^{ds} \to \Z_{\geq 0}$ induces a restriction functor $\text{res}: \Fil \to \Gr.$  The restriction is right adjoint to a functor $I: \Gr \to \Fil$ given by left Kan extension.  The functor $I$ can be thought of as taking a graded spectrum $X_0,X_1,X_2,\cdots$ to the filtered spectrum $X_0\to X_0\oplus X_1\to X_0\oplus X_1\oplus X_2\to \cdots.$    There is also an associated graded functor $\text{gr }: \Fil \to \Gr$ such that the composite $\text{gr }\circ I : \Gr \to \Gr$ is an equivalence.   

%paragraph describes the monoidal structures
The categories $\Gr$ and $\Fil$ are given symmetric monoidal structures via the Day convolution; we denote the operation in both cases by $\otimes$.  The unit $\S0^{gr}$ of $\otimes$ in graded spectra is $S^0$ in degree 0 and $*$ otherwise; the unit $\S0^{fil}$ in filtered spectra is $I\S0^{gr}.$  

The functors $I$ and $\text{gr}$ can be given symmetric monoidal structures such that the composite $\text{gr }\circ I : \Gr \to \Gr$ is a symmetric monoidal equivalence.  It follows in particular that they extend to functors on between the categories of $\E_n$ algebras in $\Gr$ and $\Fil$.  Thus, given an $\E_n$ algebra $Y$ in filtered spectra, we obtain a canonical $\E_n$ structure on its associated graded $\text{gr}(Y).$  Conversely, given $X\in \Alg_{\E_n}(\Fil)$


%, and thus induces a functor $I:\Alg_{\E_n}(\Gr)\to \Alg_{\E_n}(\Fil).$   Similarly, the functor $\text{gr}$ can be given a symmetric monoidal structure such that the 
%As such, it makes sense to talk about $\mathbb{E}_n$ algebras in $\Fil$ and $\Gr$.  In fact, 

%maybe we should set apart the definitions that jacob did not already make?
\begin{dfn}
An object $X\in \Alg_{\E_n}(\Fil)$ is called \emph{$\E_n$-split} if it is in the essential image of $I$.  
\end{dfn}

Given an $\E_n$-split filtered spectrum $X$, we can recover the underlying graded spectrum by taking the associated graded. 


\section{The (Segal-Mitchell-Richter?) Filtration on $\Omega SU(n)$}

I believe Mitchell shows in \cite{MitchellSU(n)} that the filtration is filtered $\mathbb{A}_\infty$.  We need to check this.

\begin{cnj} The filtration is $\mathbb{E}_2$.
\end{cnj}
I guess now we know this is just true.  We should probably thank Jacob for bringing to our attention that this conjecture of Mahowald is actually well-known by geometric representation theorists.  
%We can leave this as a conjecture if we don't make easy progress on it.  Seems potentially hard.  We should cite Rotation Invariance for the $n \rightarrow \infty$ case and explain that our conjecture would be a refinement of the one in \cite{MahowaldRichter}.  It might also be worth briefly digging into \cite{MitchellLoopGroup} to see if our arguments generalize to broader loop group contexts.  We could also see if the splitting of all loops of Steifel manifolds is $\mathbb{A}_\infty$-structure, and not just $\Omega SU(n)$.  We can always write a sequel to this preprint if we feel like it.

\section{An $\mathbb{A}_\infty$-splitting by Weiss Calculus}


In this section, we extend the methods of \cite{Arone} to produce $\mathbb{A}_\infty$ stable splittings of Stiefel manifolds.  
%some sort of outline
%Review of weiss calculus
%monoidalness of Weiss Calculus
%general splitting machinery
\subsection{Weiss Calculus}
%cite Weiss
Let $\J$ be the $\infty$-category which is the nerve of the topological category whose objects are finite dimensional complex vector spaces equipped with a Hermitian inner product and whose morphisms are spaces of linear isometries.  


\subsection{General splitting machinery}


Let $[n]$ denote the linearly ordered set of integers $0\leq i\leq n$.  Define $\Fil_n = \text{Fun}([n], \Sp^{\J})$ and $\Cofil_n = \text{Fun}([n]^{\text{op}},\Sp^{\J})$.  These categories admit functors to $\Sp^{\J}$ by taking colimit and limit, respectively.  Let $\C_n = \Fil_n \times_{\Sp^{\J}} \Cofil_n.$  Finally, let $\Gr_n = \text{Fun}([n]^{\text{ds}}, \Sp^{\J})$ where $[n]^{\text{ds}}$ denotes the underlying discrete category.  We have the following lemma:

\begin{lem}
For all integers $n>0$, there is a fully faithful functor $i_n:\Gr_{n+1} \to \C_n.$  
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
An element of $\C_n$ is given by a sequence of maps 

The proof is by induction.  
\end{proof}

We may then take inverse limits to get a category $\C_\infty = \Fil(\Sp^{\J}) \times_{\Sp^{\J}} \Cofil(\Sp^{\J})$ and a functor $i: \Gr \to \C_\infty$. 

\begin{cor}
The functor $i$ is fully faithful.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
%This amounts to checking that taking inverse limits retains fully faithfulness.  I think this is totally obvious if you were taking an inverse limit of simplicial sets, but maybe we need to be a little careful since we want a homotopy limit?
\end{proof}


at the end, restrict connectivity so that it's monoidal








\section{An $\mathbb{E}_2$-splitting in Complex Cobordism}

Let $R$ denote any $\mathbb{E}_2$-ring spectrum with even-concentrated homotopy groups.  I claim that any $\mathbb{A}_\infty$-morphism $\Omega SU(n) \rightarrow R$ lifts to an $\mathbb{E}_2$-morphism.

The argument is inspired by \cite{ChadwickMandell}
\begin{proof}
The obstructions live in $H_*(\Omega SU(n);\pi_{*+1}(R))$, and no matter the value of $\pi_{*+1}(R)$ this is $0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
If $R$ is the relevant split $MU$-$\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra, this yields an $MU$-$\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra equivalence $\Omega SU(n) \smsh MU \rightarrow R$ by adjunction from the $\mathbb{E}_2$-map $\Omega SU(n) \rightarrow R$.
\end{cor}

\section{Obstructions to a general $\mathbb{E}_2$-splitting}

Suppose there is a map $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n) \rightarrow \Sigma^{\infty}_+ \mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$.  This is adjoint to a double loop map $\Omega SU(n) \rightarrow GL_1(\Sigma^{\infty}_+\mathbb{CP}^{n-1})$ which lands in the component $SL_1(\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \mathbb{CP}^{n-1}) \simeq \Omega^2 \Sigma^2 \mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$.  BLAH BLAH
%maybe remark that BU -> QCP^\infty not being E_2 is still true after taking \Sigma^\infty_+, and remark that this is like a version of the splitting principle.

\section{Snaith's Construction of Periodic Complex Bordism}

A classical theorem of Snaith \cite{SnaithOriginal} gives an equivalence of homotopy commutative ring spectra $$\Sigma^{\infty}_+ BU [\beta^{-1}] \simeq MUP.$$  The equivalence arises from considering the total $MU$-Chern class map $BU \to GL_1(MUP).$  It is known from \cite{SnaithNotMultiplicative} that the total Chern class in integral homology is not an infinite loop map.  It follows from the existence of an $\E_\infty$ map $MUP \to H\Z P$ from periodic complex bordism to periodic integral homology that Snaith's equivalence is not an equivalence of $\E_\infty$ ring spectra.  The following theorem refines this observation:


%should check if the obstruction in SnaithNotMultiplicative is also E_3...I would think it is
%should we also cite the totaro paper that does literally the same thing as SnaithNotMultiplicative?

\begin{thm}
The equivalence $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ BU [\beta^{-1}] \simeq MUP$ is $\mathbb{E}_2$ but not $\mathbb{E}_3$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Proof goes here
\end{proof}

Comment now about GepnerSnaith.
We should cite at some point here or the introduction all of \cite{SnaithNotMultiplicative},  \cite{GepnerSnaith}, and the Snaith book with the original splitting.

\section{Miscellaneous stuff here}

It would be nice to at some point deal with showing the associated graded $E_2$ structure of BU is the thom spectrum VMU(n).  I've directly pasted in some writing from a previous argument I claimed, but it definitely uses that $\coprod BU(n)$ is an $E_2$ algebra over $\Z _{\geq 0}$ which I never got straight an actual proof of.  

\begin{prop}The associated graded of $\Sigma^{\infty}_+BU$ is $E_2$ equivalent to the Thom spectrum $\bigvee MU(n).$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $R = BU$ with its natural filtration, and let $R^{\oplus} = \coprod BU(n)$ with its natural filtration.  Let $M$ be the ($E_\infty$) filtered spectrum which is $MU(n)$ in degree $n$, and all maps are $0$.  In other words, $\bigvee MU(n)$ with its natural filtration is $I(res(M))$.  

We begin with a filtered $E_\infty$ map $z:R^\oplus \to I(res(M))$ coming from the zero section.  Then, $R^\oplus$ comes with the structure of an $E_2$ algebra over $\Z_{\geq 0}^{fil}$.  In fact, $I(res(M))$  has a trivial structure as an $E_\infty$-algebra over $\Z_{\geq 0}^{fil}$ via the augmentation $\Z_{\geq 0}^{fil}\to S^{0,fil} \to I(res(M))$.  We may then tensor $z$ along the augmentation to get a map of $E_2$ filtered spectra $z':R \to I(res(M))$.  

There is a canonical equivalence $I(res(M)) \otimes \mathbb{A} \simeq M$ because $M$ is in the image of $\mathbb{A} \otimes I(-)$ (that is, all the maps in the filtration of $M$ were zero).  As such, $M$ acquires a canonical structure as an $\mathbb{A}$ algebra such that the map $M \otimes \mathbb{A} \to M$ is a map of $E_2$ rings (in fact I think it's $E_\infty$?).  

Finally, we observe that we may tensor $z'$ with $\mathbb{A}$ and compose with the multiplication map to get an $E_2$ map $R\otimes A \to M \otimes A \to M$ which is the right thing up to homotopy, so it's an equivalence.  
\end{proof}

******  

What is $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n)[\beta^{-1}]$, by the way?  Is it related to a periodic version of the $X(n)$-filtration of $MU$??
