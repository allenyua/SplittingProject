I believe Mitchell shows in \cite{MitchellSU(n)} that the filtration is filtered $\mathbb{A}_\infty$.


\begin{dfn}
Let $\mathbb{C}((t))$ denote $\mathbb{C}[[t]][t^{-1}]$.  A \textit{lattice} $L$ is a finitely-generated $\mathbb{C}[[t]]$-submodule of $\mathbb{C}((t))^n$ such that $L \otimes_{\mathbb{C}[[t]]} \mathbb{C}((t))=\mathbb{C}((t))^n.$  A lattice $L$ is \textit{special} if $\Lambda^n L = \mathbb{C}[[t]] \subset \mathbb{C}((t))$.  More generally, if $R$ is any $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, an $R$-family of special lattices is a finitely generated projective $R[[t]]$-submodule of $R((t))^n$ satisfying similar properties.
\end{dfn}

The set of special lattices carries a natural topology modeling $\Omega SU(n)$.  The notion of $R$-families of special lattices gives a functor of points description of the algebro-geometric affine Grassmannian, which is an Ind-scheme over $\mathbb{C}$.  As with any affine Grassmannian, there is a natural filtration of this Ind-schemes by genuine schemes, indexed by the coweights of $SU(n)$:
