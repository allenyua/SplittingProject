I believe Mitchell shows in \cite{MitchellSU(n)} that the filtration is filtered $\mathbb{A}_\infty$.  We need to check this.

\begin{cnj} The filtration is $\mathbb{E}_2$.
\end{cnj}
I guess now we know this is just true.  We should probably thank Jacob for bringing to our attention that this conjecture of Mahowald is actually well-known by geometric representation theorists.  
%We can leave this as a conjecture if we don't make easy progress on it.  Seems potentially hard.  We should cite Rotation Invariance for the $n \rightarrow \infty$ case and explain that our conjecture would be a refinement of the one in \cite{MahowaldRichter}.  It might also be worth briefly digging into \cite{MitchellLoopGroup} to see if our arguments generalize to broader loop group contexts.  We could also see if the splitting of all loops of Steifel manifolds is $\mathbb{A}_\infty$-structure, and not just $\Omega SU(n)$.  We can always write a sequel to this preprint if we feel like it.
