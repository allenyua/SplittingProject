We study the homotopy type of the affine Grassmannian of $SL_n(\mathbb{C})$, which is equivalent to the space $\Omega SU(n)$ of based loops in $SU(n)$.  There are essentially two multiplications on this homotopy type, one arising from the composition of loops and the other from the group multiplication on $SL_n(\mathbb{C})$.  Together, these two multiplications interact to give $\Omega SU(n)$ the structure of an $\mathbb{E}_2$ or fusion algebra.  In geometric representation theory, this structure is witnessed by the existence of the Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannian.

Using either of the above (homotopy equivalent) products, it is possible to make $H_*(\Omega SU(n);\mathbb{Z})$ into a graded ring.  To describe this ring, let us first name some of its elements.  For each one-dimensional subspace $V \subset \mathbb{C}^n$, there is a loop $\lambda_V:S^1 \rightarrow U(n)$ given by the formula
$$\lambda_V(z)=\left( \begin{array}{cc} z & 0 \\ 0 & I \end{array} \right),$$
with the matrix presented in terms of the decomposition $\mathbb{C}^n \cong V \oplus V^{\perp}$.  Fixing a particular line $W \subset \mathbb{C}^n$, the construction $V \mapsto \lambda_W^{-1} \cdot \lambda_V$ defines a well-known map
$$\mathbb{CP}^{n-1} \rightarrow \Omega SU(n).$$
Let $b_1,b_2,...,b_{n-1}$, $|b_i|=2i$, denote the images in $H_*(\Omega SU(n);\mathbb{Z})$ of the generators of $H_*(\mathbb{CP}^{n-1};\mathbb{Z})$.  It is a result of Bott \cite{Bott} that
$$H_*(\Omega SU(n);\mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}[b_1,b_2,\cdots],$$
with the latter denoting the polynomial algebra on the classes $b_i$.

Notice, in particular, that $H_*(\Omega SU(n);\mathbb{Z})$ is naturally a \textit{bigraded} ring, one grading being given by $*$ and the other by assigning each $b_i$ degree $1$.  Mahowald observed that the action of the Steenrod algebra on $H_*(\Omega SU(n);\mathbb{F}_2)$ preserves this second degree, and he conjectured a geometric splitting to be responsible.  Indeed, it was eventually proven by Mitchell and Richter \cite[Theorem 2.1]{CrabbMitchell}, that the suspension spectrum $\Sigma^{\infty} \Omega SU(n)$ splits as an infinite wedge sum:
$$\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n) \simeq \mathbb{S} \vee \Sigma^{\infty} \mathbb{CP}^{n-1} \vee \cdots.$$

In order to prove this splitting, Mitchell \cite{MitchellSU(n)} (and, independently, Segal \cite{Segal}) first constructed a filtration of the space $\Omega SU(n)$.  Following Mitchell, we name this the \textit{Bott filtration} of $\Omega SU(n)$.  The first filtered piece is given by the above map $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1} \rightarrow \Omega SU(n)$, and the theorem of Mitchell and Richter is that the filtration stably splits.  The construction of the Bott filtration is somewhat involved, and we review it in Section \ref{sec:MRFil}--it is a subfiltration of the Bruhat ordering on (closures of) Iwahori orbits.

\begin{exm}
In the case $n=2$, the Bott filtration of $\Omega SU(2) \simeq \Omega S^3$ is the classical James filtration of $\Omega \Sigma S^2$.
\end{exm}

In Section \ref{sec:FilGra}, we review the symmetric monoidal structures on the ($\infty$)-categories of filtered and graded spectra.  This allows us to properly state our first main theorem, proven in Section \ref{sec:MRFil}:

\begin{thm} \label{thm:BottIsAoo}
The suspension of the Bott filtration 
$$\mathbb{S} \longrightarrow \Sigma_+^{\infty} \mathbb{CP}^{n-1} \simeq \Sigma_+^{\infty} F_{n,1} \longrightarrow \Sigma_+^{\infty} F_{n,2} \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow \Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n).$$
is an $\mathbb{A}_\infty$-algebra object in filtered spectra.
\end{thm}

\begin{rmk}
The Bott filtration is multiplicative before suspension, but for technical reasons we prefer to phrase our results in terms of filtered spectra instead of filtered spaces.
\end{rmk}

\begin{qst} \label{qst:BottE2}
Is the Bott filtration an $\mathbb{E}_2$ filtration?  We do not know the answer--for some thoughts about the problem, see Remark \ref{rmk:E2fil}.
\end{qst}

The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:BottIsAoo} is fairly straightforward, once given access to the sophisticated machinery behind the Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannian.  For example, we will explain in Section \ref{sec:MRFil} that this machinery immediately dispenses with a conjecture of Mahowald and Richter \cite{MahowaldRichter}.  Nonetheless, there are some subtleties involved, and it is these subtleties that prevent us from determining if the Bott filtration is $\mathbb{E}_2$.  The problem is readily visible in the case $n=\infty$:

\begin{exm}
The limiting case of the Bott filtration of $\Omega SU(n)$ as $n$ tends to $\infty$ is the filtration
$$* \longrightarrow BU(1) \longrightarrow BU(2) \longrightarrow BU(3) \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow BU \simeq \Omega SU.$$
It is easy to see that $\coprod BU(n)$ is a graded $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra in spaces (in fact, it is a graded $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-algebra, being the nerve of the category of vector spaces).  However, the filtered object is much more subtle.  For example, the squares
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
BU(i) \times BU(j) \arrow{d} \arrow{r} & BU(i) \times BU(j+1) \arrow{d} \\
BU(i+1) \times BU(j) \arrow{r} & BU(i+1) \times BU(j+1)
\end{tikzcd}
$$
do not commute on the nose, but only up to non-canonical homotopy.
\end{exm}

Though we do not know that the Bott filtration is $\mathbb{E}_2$, there is a natural $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure on its associated graded.  We end Section \ref{sec:MRFil} with a sketch of its construction:

\begin{cnstr} \label{cnstr:IntroGr}
Let $\text{gr}(\Sigma^{\infty}_+\{F_{n,k}\})$ denote the associated graded of the Bott filtration of $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n)$.  There exists a graded $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure on the graded spectrum $\text{gr}(\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \{F_{n,k}\})$ that extends the canonical graded $\mathbb{A}_\infty$-algebra structure.
\end{cnstr}

\begin{exm}
Recall once more that, as $n$ tends to $\infty$, the Bott filtration is given by
$$* \longrightarrow BU(1) \longrightarrow BU(2) \longrightarrow BU(3) \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow BU \simeq \Omega SU.$$
The associated graded of the stable Bott filtration is then given by
$$
\bigvee_n \Sigma^{\infty} BU(n+1)/BU(n) \simeq \bigvee_n MU(n),
$$
where $MU(n)$ is the Thom spectrum of the canonical bundle over $BU(n)$.  In this case, the Mitchell-Richter splitting recovers an older splitting due to Snaith \cite{SnaithBook}
$$\Sigma^{\infty}_+ BU \simeq \bigvee_n MU(n).$$
The $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure described in Construction \ref{cnstr:IntroGr} is that arising from the Thom construction applied to 
$$\coprod BU(n) \stackrel{J}{\longrightarrow} Pic(\mathbb{S}).$$
This should be compared with the $\mathbb{E}_2$-ring structure on $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ BU$ that arises from the double loop space structure on $BU$.
\end{exm}

The remainder of the paper is concerned with the stable splitting of the Bott filtration.  Our main results are as follows:

\begin{thm} \label{thm:MainAoo}
As an $\mathbb{A}_\infty$-algebra object in filtered spectra, the Bott filtration of $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n)$ is equivalent to its associated graded.
\end{thm}

\begin{cor}
For any homology theory $E$, $E_*(\Omega SU(n))$ is a bigraded ring.  One grading is given by $*$, and the other by the associated graded of the Bott filtration.
\end{cor}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:MainObstruction}
Suppose $n \ge 4$.  If the Bott filtration of $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n)$ may be made into an $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra object in filtered spectra, then it is \textbf{not} equivalent to its $\mathbb{E}_2$ associated graded.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:MainMUE2}
Let $MU$ denote the $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring spectrum of complex bordism.  For any $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure on the underlying (ungraded) $\mathbb{A}_\infty$-ring $\text{gr}(\Sigma^{\infty}_+\{F_{n,k}\})$, there is an equivalence of $\mathbb{E}_2$-$MU$-algebras
$$MU \smsh \Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n) \simeq MU \smsh \text{gr}(\Sigma^{\infty}_+\{F_{n,k}\}).$$
\end{thm}

\begin{rmk}
It is Construction \ref{cnstr:IntroGr} that gives Theorem \ref{thm:MainMUE2} its teeth.  The result may be seen as a once-looped analogue of work of Kitchloo \cite{Kitchloo}.   Kitchloo studied a splitting, due to Miller \cite{MillerSplitting}, of $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ SU(n)$.  His theorem is that, \textit{for complex-oriented $E$}, the corresponding direct sum decomposition of $E_*(SU(n))$ is multiplicative.
\end{rmk}

Our proof of Theorem \ref{thm:MainMUE2} is by obstruction theory.  We show in Section \ref{sec:MUE2} that all obstructions to an $\mathbb{E}_2$-equivalence vanish.  On the other hand, we prove Theorem \ref{thm:MainObstruction} by explicitly calculating a non-zero obstruction in Section \ref{sec:Obstruction}.  It remains to discuss Theorem \ref{thm:MainAoo}, the $\mathbb{A}_\infty$ splitting, which is the major result of our paper.

To prove that a filtered spectrum
$$A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow A_3 \longrightarrow \cdots$$
splits, it suffices to provide splitting maps
$$A_1 \longleftarrow A_2 \longleftarrow A_3 \longleftarrow \cdots$$
such that each composite $A_i \rightarrow A_{i+1} \rightarrow A_i$ is the identity.  In Section \ref{sec:SplittingMachine} we upgrade this to a multiplicative, coherent statement:

\begin{thm}
Let $X\in \Alg_{\E_n}(\Fil)$ be an $\E_n$ filtered spectrum.  Suppose there exists an $\E_n$ cofiltered spectrum $Y\in \Alg_{\E_n}(\Cofil)$ with the following two properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is an equivalence $\colim X \simeq \lim Y$ of $\E_n$-algebras in spectra.
\item The resulting natural maps $X_i \to Y_i$ are equivalences.  
\end{enumerate}
Then, the filtered spectrum $X$ is $\E_n$-split.
\end{thm}

We proceed in Sections \ref{sec:MultWeiss} and \ref{sec:AooSplit} to produce an $\mathbb{A}_\infty$ cofiltered spectrum splitting the Bott filtration of $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ \Omega SU(n)$.  The idea here is to exploit a beautiful idea of \cite{Arone}, who used Weiss calculus to give a second proof of the (unstructured) Mitchell--Richter splitting.

There are a number of natural and presumably approachable open questions suggested by our work here.  In addition to Question \ref{qst:BottE2}, we highlight the following:

\begin{qst}
\textbf{
Allen, can you put in something about the strongest form of multiplicativity of Goodwillie/Weiss calculus that should be true but isn't proven?
}
\end{qst}

\begin{qst}
Is the Mitchell--Richter filtration of the loop space of a Stiefel manifold always filtered $\mathbb{A}_\infty$?  This is the only obstruction to promoting Theorem \ref{thm:MainAoo} to a result about all such loop spaces.
\end{qst}

\begin{qst}
What are the proper motivic analogues of our results, phrased in the category of $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant Nisnevich sheaves?
\end{qst}

\begin{qst}
What are the proper equivariant analogues of our result?  See for example \cite{Ullman}, \cite{Tynan}.
\end{qst}
