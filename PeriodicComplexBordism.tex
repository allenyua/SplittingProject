A classical theorem of Snaith \cite{SnaithOriginal} gives an equivalence of homotopy commutative ring spectra $$\Sigma^{\infty}_+ BU [\beta^{-1}] \simeq MUP.$$  The equivalence arises from considering the total $MU$-Chern class map $BU \to GL_1(MUP).$  It is known from \cite{SnaithNotMultiplicative} that the total Chern class in integral homology is not an infinite loop map.  It follows from the existence of an $\E_\infty$ map $MUP \to H\Z P$ from periodic complex bordism to periodic integral homology that Snaith's equivalence is not an equivalence of $\E_\infty$ ring spectra.  The following theorem refines this observation:


%should check if the obstruction in SnaithNotMultiplicative is also E_3...I would think it is
%should we also cite the totaro paper that does literally the same thing as SnaithNotMultiplicative?

\begin{thm}
The equivalence $\Sigma^{\infty}_+ BU [\beta^{-1}] \simeq MUP$ is $\mathbb{E}_2$ but not $\mathbb{E}_3$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Proof goes here
\end{proof}

Comment now about GepnerSnaith.
We should cite at some point here or the introduction all of \cite{SnaithNotMultiplicative},  \cite{GepnerSnaith}, and the Snaith book with the original splitting.
